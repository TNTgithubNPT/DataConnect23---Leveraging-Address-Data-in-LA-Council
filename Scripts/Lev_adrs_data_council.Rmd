# Embedding Data Standards

# What Address Data Standards?

## GeoPlace

--

* Source of UK Address Data Standards

--

- Central source for UK addresses and streets, working with over 300 councils across England and Wales which have a statutory responsibility for approving and creating addresses. 46.5 million addresses, 2 million records update monthly. 

--

<ins>Stringent data quality process</ins>

- Matches against records from several authoritative government property/address databases.

- Validation and assurance process that runs 100s of checks on each record before being accepted into the database.

--

- Data is enriched and transformed by adding best attributes from source datasets to enhance quality of overall product.

- The Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) is the unique identifier for every addressable location across the UK. Every addressable location in Great Britain is uniquely identified by the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN). 

---


# Situation

--

## Large volume of Address Data

NPTCBC has approximately 350 known applications, many using address data. Address data exists in many forms across the council including spreadsheets and word documents across departments including Social Care, Environment, Digital Services.
<!-- Councils have a large number of different departments, including Social Care, Environment, Digital Services. -->
<!-- Address data is vital to the delivery of all these functions. We do not know the depth and breadth of applications that use address data and how they use address data.  -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- ## Disjointed -->

<!-- Duplicate Address data held in different places, with no immediate way to link across departments.  -->
<!-- -- -->

--


## Standards
There is a tremendous opportunity for an agreed/mandated address data standard to be put in place across the council for the first time. This includes ubiquity of recording/validating addresses and the concepts of UPRN and USRN, emanating from a central address repository known to most (if not all) who record addresses.
<!-- ## Accessiblity -->
<!-- Address data can be used by a wide variety of different applications, that may be known to exist by a few people or the address data is hard to share.  -->
--

## Quality
Address Data in the council meets varying degrees of fitness for purpose. There's also a tremendous opportunity to elevate the breadth and depth of understanding the address data quality across the council.

# Motivation - Embedding Data Standards would improve:

--

## Staff awareness

Promotion of the concept of a standardised address format, and signposting to training resources would dissemminate the established address data standards. Staff awareness will improve quality of address data inputted by causing people to be more careful.
--

## Data Quality

Ascribing to these data standards would ensure fitness for purpose of addresss data across many applications, increase options to leverage the data and reduce time to understand data. The source of data will always be Geoplace/LLPG, a quality assured source.

.pull-right[Royal Mail require the following to deliver in expected time frames:
* 1 premise element
* 1 thoroughfare element
* 1 locality element
* the postcode as a minimum

Myany departments would have difficulty getting information to people for addresses that don't meet this.
]
---

# Motivation - Embedding Data Standards would improve:

## Data Linkage

Integration of all current applications that use addresses within the council with the LLPG for local addresses and NPG for national addresses. The integration will add UPRN, USRN, and possibly other useful data to any of the datasets, enabling linkage across teams and enabling sharing of data. UPRN is gold standard, various data quality analysis/measurements fills the gap.

Once we have done embedding, we will be able to link on an address. As you can imagine, it's very difficult to know precise immediate impact on each business area, but it certainly makes us more ***resilient*** to any change in the future.

# What are we Doing/Aiming to do? Part 1

--

## Self-Service Address App

--

* Prescriptive approach to capturing new addresses.

 + we create the way data is presented and standardised, eg getting new address to send in a letter format.

 + Single point of contact that unifies many ad-hoc queries around address data

--


* User centered designed access to suit of address products/standards

 + OS Data Hub, LLPG, Royal Mail - PAF, Metadata repository.
 
--

<br> 
* What would you like to see in a self-service address data dashboard/app?

--

 + What other dashboard would you need?

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.link-style1 a {

  text-decoration: underline;
}

.link-style2 a {
 color: blue;
}


```

# Address Matching Algorithms


--

* It's easy to standardise new addresses - EG, source from OS AddressBase

--

* Enhancing quality of current/historic addresses is a challenge. EG, linking with OS AddressBase.

## Literature Review

 *  ASSIGN, OS Places API, addressMatchR,IdoxMatch's Aligned Assets platform, ONS address index (AI) project

 * This is what we're working on so far.

# What are we Doing/Aiming to do? Part 2

--

## Champion

Promote the concept of a standardized address format to all staff, and signpost to training resources.

--


## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Create an SOP of how to record and validate addresses, UPRNs and USRNs in the day-to-day work on spreadsheets or similar until automation. 

--

## Data Linking
Linking datasets across various domains so that the council can have a broader view of council residents' experience. 

--

## Data Quality Assessments

Using the data quality dimensions from the Data Quality Hub, we have commenced some Data Quality Reports on address datasets within various domains across the business. This is helping us understand the data quality and the cost/benefit on various data quality improvement actions such as data cleaning or address matching to a UPRN. For example, de-duplicating and completeness (eg, filling in missing towns in otherwise complete addresses)
---

# Examples so Far

## Expansion letters
A key unit within NPTCBC needed to distribute letters to particular areas of deprivation. 

* Programmatically generated list of addresses from Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) based on deprivation scores.
* OS Data HUB APIs and LLPG used as data sources
* Address letter outputs ascribed to Royal Mail PAF and Gov notify. 

## Data Quality Assessments
We have programmatically produced data quality assessment reports on the address data of various areas, such as social care.
  * Data quality Dimensions
  * give view of fitness for purpose
